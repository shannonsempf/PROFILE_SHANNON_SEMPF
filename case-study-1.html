                            <span class="bold-word">Donation:</span>   As the cat protection society of NSW is a non-for-profit organisation it relies heavily on donations from the public & volunteers in order to operate. Without regular donations and volunteers the organisation will not be able to continue assisting animals in need.

                            <span class="bold-word">Adoption:</span> One of the primary aims of the cat protection society of NSW is to provide as many pets as possible with a loving home. As the CPS of NSW only has a limited number of spaces availible at the organisation, the number of pets they are able to help is usually limited by adoption rates. By increasing adoption rates we will increase the number of pets the organisation can rehome, thereby better helping them to achive their goal of “helping as many pets as possible find loving homes”
